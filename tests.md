# TESTS
Tests for simple Web server.

## Http request
Example htttp request as seen by a server running on port 8080. Run dumper.py and type in the url 0.0.0.0:8080 in your browser to see incoming requests.

### Test request using curl

Run the following command to check the http response and compare agianst our liso response :  ``` curl -I http://amazon.com ```
```
curl -I http://amazon.com
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Server: Server
Date: Mon, 02 Oct 2017 01:27:38 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 179
Connection: keep-alive
Location: https://amazon.com/

```

Start the server on port 8080. Now run the following command to send request to liso server : ```  curl -I 127.0.0.1:8080/index.html or curl --head 127.0.0.1:8080/index.html ``` 
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Content-Length: 796
Content-Type: text/html
Date: Mon, 02 Oct 2017 01:32:23 GMT
Last-Modified: Sun, 24 Sep 2017 20:20:01 GMT
Server: Liso/1.0
```

Similarly curl can be sued to test GET and POST requests.

```
GET : curl 127.0.0.1:8080/index.html
POST: curl -i  --data  "name=nish" 127.0.0.1:8080 
HEAD: curl --head 127.0.0.1:8080/index.html

```



## Memory Leak Check

We used the memcheck tool from Valgrind to detect if there's any memory leaks in our program.
>From Valgrind.org :   For Ubuntu linux ``` sudo apt-get install valgrind ```

>Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. It comes with a set of tools each of which performs some kind of debugging, profiling, or similar task that helps you improve your programs. Valgrindâ€™s architecture is modular, so new tools can be created easily and without disturbing the existing structure.

One of the useful tools provided by Valgring is Memcheck, which is a memory error detector. It helps you make your programs, particularly those written in C and C++, more correct.

To test our server code, run:
>valgrind --leak-check=full -v ./lisod <portnumber>

Here's the result we got after running the memory check:
![memCheck](./images/memLeak.png)
We can see that there appears to be no leaks in our server code. Hooray!
