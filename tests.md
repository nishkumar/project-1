# TESTS
Tests for simple Web server.

## Http request
Example htttp request as seen by a server running on port 8080. Run dumper.py and type in the url 0.0.0.0:8080 in your browser to see incoming requests.


## Memory Leak Check

We used the memcheck tool from Valgrind to detect if there's any memory leaks in our program.
>From Valgrind.org :

>Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. It comes with a set of tools each of which performs some kind of debugging, profiling, or similar task that helps you improve your programs. Valgrindâ€™s architecture is modular, so new tools can be created easily and without disturbing the existing structure.

One of the useful tools provided by Valgring is Memcheck, which is a memory error detector. It helps you make your programs, particularly those written in C and C++, more correct.

To test our server code, run:
>valgrind --leak-check=full -v ./lisod <portnumber>

Here's the result we got after running the memory check:

We can see that there appears to be no leaks in our server code. Hooray!
